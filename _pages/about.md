I am currently a postdoc researcher at the International Computer Science Institute ([ICSI](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/)), an affiliated institute of [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from School of Computer Science, Fudan University, China in June 2024, advised by Prof. [Chen Jingjing](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/people/jingjingchen/list.htm) and [Jiang Yu-Gang](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/people/yugangjiang/). I also collaborate with Prof. [Wu Zuxuan](https://zxwu.azurewebsites.net/) closely. Before that, I received my B.E. and M.Sc. from Jilin University in June 2017 and June 2020. I was also a visiting student from October 2018 to June 2019 at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [CHUA Tat Seng](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).

My research interests are in the robustness of deep learning. 
Recently, I have been focusing on enhancing the robustness of Large Models.
